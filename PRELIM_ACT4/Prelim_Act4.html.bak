			<div class="desc">"Avatar"</div>
			<p>Avatar is an American science fiction film written and directed by James Cameron, 
			starring Sam Worthington, Zoë Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney 
			Weaver. It was made by Lightstorm Entertainment and released by 20th Century Fox on December 18, 2009. 
			The film is set in the year 2154 on Pandora, a fictional Earth-like moon in a distant planetary system. 
			Humans are engaged in mining Pandora's reserves of a precious mineral known as unobtanium, while the
			Na'vi — the sapient and sentient race of humanoids indigenous to the moon — resist the colonists' expansion, 
			which threatens the continued existence of the Na'vi and the Pandoran ecosystem. The film's title 
			refers to the remotely controlled, genetically engineered human-Na'vi bodies used by the film's human characters to interact with the indigenous population.</p>

			<p>R is having a no-life crisis—he is a zombie. He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, 
			but he is a little different from his fellow Dead. He may occasionally eat people, but he’d 
			rather be riding abandoned airport escalators, listening to Sinatra in the 
			cozy 747 he calls home, or collecting souvenirs from the ruins of civilization.</p>
